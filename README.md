# AR/VR Module – Unity Labs

> _"You might wonder what Artificial Intelligence has to do with Augmented and Virtual Reality... but once you step into the 3D world, the connection becomes more real than ever."_ 🤖🕶️

This journey through Unity's 3D environment wasn't just about placing objects or designing spaces — it was about **understanding immersive systems**, and **preparing the ground for intelligent, interactive environments**.

While these labs may look purely visual or game-oriented at first glance, the **logic, interaction, and real-time responsiveness** we built here are exactly where AI fits in — from smart NPCs to adaptive puzzles and virtual agents.



## 🔧 Labs Overview

### 🔹 Lab 1: Unity Basics – 3D Environment & Interface
Got familiar with Unity's interface and 3D space manipulation. Created and arranged basic 3D objects, explored cameras, lighting, and movement controls.

### 🔹 Lab 2: Scripting in Unity – C# & Game Logic
Learned how to add behavior to objects using C#. Covered object properties, events, components, and basic game mechanics.

### 🔹 Lab 3: 3D Puzzle Game
Developed a simple 3D puzzle using cubes. Focused on object interaction, correct order logic, and visual feedback. This lab sharpened our understanding of game state management.

### 🔹 Lab 4: 3D Bowling Game
Created a mini bowling game in 3D! Simulated physics, ball movement, collisions, and scoring. It was a fun way to combine logic, animation, and interaction.
